## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)

## review and iterate
* lots to learn from [omalley@'s solution](https://github.com/omalley/advent_of_code_2023/blob/trunk/src/day5.rs) - error handling niceties, never calculates the full data, just works with ranges, nice!

## things to learn about
* consider using unoptimized part02 as an excuse to play with parallelization with Rayon.
