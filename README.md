# Advent of Code

Public repo for my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions. I usually use AoC to learn new things, these solutions likely vary in quality ... a lot. :)  I'm publishing because I've learned so much from other's shared solutions. Hopefully someone finds these useful on their learning path as well!

Take care,
-Brian
