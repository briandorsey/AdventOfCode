This took me the longest yet. Hope it stays as the high water mark. Mostly because I tried multiple approaches that didn't work for part 2. Re-reading the question contained a hint to an approach that worked find. Doh! It's always reading.

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* `loop` was helpful to avoid keeping references to a datastructure that I needed to mutate while looping over. `for` wouldn't have worked, I don't think.
* `HashSet` doesn't have `.pop()` - seems to be on purpose to avoid folks accidentally writing slow code. Several of the comments recommend [IndexMap / IndexSet](https://github.com/bluss/indexmap) instead. Looks good and says it's pretty much the same speed as the std library ones.
