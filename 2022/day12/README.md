I didn't take any notes along the way... got too into the problem, I guess. I spent nearly all the time preparing the data and testing edge cases in the helper functions. One that was done, the pathfinding library did the work with no additional errors at all. Kind of felt like magic. 

## confusion / questions
* Not sure if this struct based solution is idiomatic Rust. It makes for a clean part 1 solution, though.

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* This is a fantastic interacive article on A* pathfinding: https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html
* `pathfinding` is perfect for this sort of thing.
