Spend many hours on this. Gave up, skipped ahead, eventually came back. Learned a lot about `petgraph`... but nearly certain there are much cleaner ways to solve this. 

So... after all that... I finally got a solution for the test input working and validated... but it doesn't work for the full input (and takes 6 minutes to run). I think I'm going to have to break down and get some hints on this one. 

TODO: use this as a benchmarking test case later. 

## confusion / questions

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* [petgraph_review](https://timothy.hobbs.cz/rust-play/petgraph_review.html) This is the best documentation I found for `petgraph`... and a great summary of graph theory and terms as well. 

## review and iterate
* meta: this one is complex enough that it's challenging to understand other solutions deeply enough to know if it does something different than I decided to do. 
* [anisse](https://github.com/anisse) gathered other folks inputs as unit tests. This might help find my implementation error - maybe get some different corner cases on a graph thats small enough to inspect? 
* seems like a common optimization is to calculate the distance between pairs of valves and just use that directly (not building a new graph from that, etc)
* TODO: definitely review other solutions for this one!
