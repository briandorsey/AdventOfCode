Spend many hours on this. Gave up, skipped ahead, eventually came back. Learned a lot about `petgraph`... but nearly certain there are much cleaner ways to solve this. 

So... after all that... I finally got a solution for the test input working and validated... but it doesn't work for the full input (and takes 6 minutes to run). I think I'm going to have to break down and get some hints on this one.

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* [petgraph_review](https://timothy.hobbs.cz/rust-play/petgraph_review.html) This is the best documentation I found for `petgraph`... and a great summary of graph theory and terms as well. 

## review and iterate
* has a [solution]()
* TODO: definitely review other solutions for this one!

## things to learn about
