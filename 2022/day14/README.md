Been doing pretty struct+method heavy solutions... going to try to do more iteration chains this time. (after reading) ... nope... gonna need to draw state on this one. 




## confusion / questions
* I love `.windows()`... but it seems only exist sometimes? On Vecs, etc. Would love to have it as a part of regular iterators! ... time passes... oh hey! `itertools` has `.tuple_windows()`

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* 

## review and iterate
* has a [solution]()
* 

## things to learn about
*
