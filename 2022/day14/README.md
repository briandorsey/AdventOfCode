Been doing pretty struct+method heavy solutions... going to try to do more iteration chains this time. (after reading) ... nope... gonna need to draw state on this one. 




## confusion / questions
* I love `.windows()`... but it seems only exist sometimes? On Vecs, etc. Would love to have it as a part of regular iterators! ... time passes... oh hey! `itertools` has `.tuple_windows()`

## TIL (Learned... or Looked up)
* `const` can be used in `impl` sections for scoped consts.
* `itertools` is great.

## review and iterate
* @whatyouhide@mas.to has a [solution](https://github.com/whatyouhide/advent_of_code_2022/blob/main/src/day14.rs) with a `match` based decision tree and `HashMap` grid. (Article from the author](https://andrealeopardi.com/posts/advent-of-code-2022/#day-14)
