Mostly imperative solution. Added a test this time around. 

Really liking [bacon](https://github.com/Canop/bacon) for autorunning `cargo` commands.

# confusion / questions
* Why does a `const` `include_str!` need a type annotation but `let var` doesn't?
* is there a version of `.retain()` that returns the sequence or an iterator for use in iterator chains?

# TIL
* include_str!
* const = unchangable, static = static lifetime, can unsafe mutate
* `color_eyre` makes for really nice error messages.

# review and iterate
* 

# things to learn about
