Got lost in nested match statements. Don't do logic too late at night. Also, did the logic manually... while this is *probably* a sort problem that could be solved by implmenting comparison / sorting? 

Implemented Ord & Eq traits to allow sorting for part2... seems like there might be a cleaner way to do it, but I just delegated to the funciton I'd created before.
