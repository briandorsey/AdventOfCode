Happy with how this one turned out overall. Yea! ðŸŽ‰

# confusion / questions
* got stuck trying to call `.windows()` on a `Chars` iterator. Seems like the workaround is to create a `Vec` and call `.windows()` on that? Why doesn't `Chars` also implement windows()? Maybe things are moving towards the `.array_chunks()` nightly? 

# TIL
* `.windows()` remains awesome. 

# review and iterate

# things to learn about
