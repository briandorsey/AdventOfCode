*phew* much more approachable than yesterday for me. Still easily thrown off by ... off by one errors. It's true what they say about the two hard problems in computer science. 

## confusion / questions
* Are methods with `&mut self` an antipattern? Seems like I can't call other methods on the struct in an `&mut self` method, so it's pretty limiting. But it also seems like we can't "upgrade" a an immutible borrow to a mutable one. Need to learn more about what kind of containers allow mutating contained values... seems like it works sometimes with `Vec`?  

## TIL
* 

## review and iterate
* has a [solution]()
* 

## things to learn about
* cases where we can get `&mut` of a portion of a container/struct/etc?
