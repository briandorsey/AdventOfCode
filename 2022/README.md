I recently started learning Rust, so I'm attempting to use Rust this year. ;) 

My general plan is to make my best attempt, then look around at other people's solutions, 
then iterate to improve my own. So there are probably multiple versions in the history for 
each solution (earlier ones are likely worse. :) )
