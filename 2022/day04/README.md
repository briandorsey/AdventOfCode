I tried to do this one as a chain of functions and only comparing ends of the ranges... and... I'm not happy with what I ended up with. :) 

# confusion
* I got somewhat lost in the math for finding overlaps. My initial working solution was actually missing a case that I only noticed while adding comments later... and then realized that case was actually covered by previous logic. Case in point. Seems like using std::ops::Range itself and/or HashSets or something where the compilier could help with the logic would be better. Will keep an eye out for that when looking at other's solutions

# TIL
* `.inspect()` is neat. 

# review and iterate
* 

# things to learn about
